# About Me
Hello! I am a rising senior at Westwood High School in Austin, Tx.
I love to build and learn. I've made a new project every other week since the 6th grade.

I'm interested in using blockchain to create verifable computing and better AI, building ASIC chips specialized for AI, and researching machine learning.

Currently, I am learning computer architecture through Nand2Tetris and working on learning ML research by recreating chat-gpt-2 through Karpathy's NN videos!
