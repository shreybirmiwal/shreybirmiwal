# About Me
Hello! I love CS and LOVE TO BUILD projects. I've made new projects every other week since the 6th grade.

I'm interested in using blockchain to create verifable computing and better AI, building ASIC chips specialized for AI, and researching machine learning.

Currently, I am working on learning ML research by recreating chat-gpt-2 through Karpathy's NN videos!
